# Visual Studio Live! Orlando - November 2025  

## Description  
This repository contains slides and code samples for sessions presented at Visual Studio Live! Orlando - November 16-21, 2025.  

## Hands-On Lab

**VSHOL03 Take Your C# Skills to the Next Level**  
**Full-day Workshop**  
*Level: Intermediate*  

Are you a C# developer eager to create software that is easy to maintain, has minimal bugs, and makes your users happy? If so, this workshop is for you.  

Through lectures, code samples, and hands-on labs, you will learn how interfaces, delegates, dependency injection, and unit testing can help you write applications that are easy to extend, change, and debug. Along the way you will also encounter modern C# topics such as nullability, switch expressions, and asynchronous code. In the end, you will take away practical experience that you can immediately apply to your own projects. Topics will include:  

* **Interfaces**: Explore the art of writing clean, modular code through interfaces. Learn how interfaces facilitate code extension, make your applications more testable, and lead to fewer bugs.  
* **Delegates**: Gain a deep understanding of delegates and learn how to use them to build flexible and extensible code.  
* **Dependency Injection**: Discover the magic of dependency injection and how it promotes loose coupling, making your codebase more flexible, testable, and maintainable.  
* **Unit Testing**: Write tests that ensure your code functions as expected, enabling you to catch bugs early in the development process.  

Key Benefits:  

* **Easier Maintenance**: Explore practices for writing clean, maintainable code that’s a breeze to work with, whether you’re collaborating with a team or revisiting your own projects down the road.  
* **Fewer Bugs**: Learn the art of writing robust code that is easy to test. Find bugs before your users do, and be confident that code changes do not break existing functionality.  
* **Happier Users**: The point of writing software is to meet your user’s needs. With these tools in hand, you can create applications that not only meet but exceed user expectations.  

Pre-Requisites:  

Basic understanding of C# and object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, methods, and properties). No prior experience with the primary topics is necessary; we’ll take care of that as we go.

## Sessions  

**VSW16 LINQ - It's Not Just for Databases**  
*Level: Intermediate*  

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is mostly associated with Entity Framework and database access. But it can be used for much more. LINQ lets us sort, filter, and aggregate data all in memory without needing to make another database call. In this session, we will build up an application that manages my book collection, including filtering, grouping, sorting, and even controlling how items are sorted. We will use the LINQ fluent syntax to combine functions and make a great user experience.

You will learn:

* How to use LINQ methods with lambda expressions as parameters.  
* Combine LINQ methods to filter, sort, and aggregate data based on the user's needs at runtime.  
* See LINQ lazy evaluation in action (and how to avoid "eager" evaluation).

**VSH04 Abstract Art: Getting Abstraction "Just Right"**  
*Level: Intermediate*  

Abstraction is awesome. And abstraction is awful. Too little, and our applications are difficult to extend and maintain. Too much, and our applications are difficult to extend and maintain. Finding the balance is the key to success. The first step is to identify your natural tendency as an under-abstractor or an over-abstractor. Once we know that, we can work on real-world techniques to dial in the level of abstraction that is "just right" for our applications.

You will learn:

* Understand the benefits and drawbacks to abstraction.  
* Techniques for getting the right level of abstractions in your application.  
* Find out whether you are an under-abstractor or over-abstractor.
