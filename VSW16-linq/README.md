# LINQ - It's Not Just for Databases  
*Level: Intermediate*  

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is mostly associated with Entity Framework and database access. But it can be used for much more. LINQ lets us sort, filter, and aggregate data all in memory without needing to make another database call. In this session, we will build up an application that manages my book collection, including filtering, grouping, sorting, and even controlling how items are sorted. We will use the LINQ fluent syntax to combine functions and make a great user experience.

You will learn:

* How to use LINQ methods with lambda expressions as parameters.  
* Combine LINQ methods to filter, sort, and aggregate data based on the user's needs at runtime.  
* See LINQ lazy evaluation in action (and how to avoid "eager" evaluation).
